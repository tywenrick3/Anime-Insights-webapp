# Midterm
Uses 2 seperate anime API's to fetch and display quotes and facts based of the selected anime character in the nav bar.

Quotes are queried by the character name, Facts are queried by the related series of the selected character.

Each time a character is clicked a random quote and fact is displayed in their corresponding components.

Clicking the same character name twice will refresh the page with new data.
